# Overview
Upon entering the site, you will be greeted with a blank canvas, and a user interface on the upper-right of the screen.

In summary:
- Draw modes are like special paint brushes (with some exceptions), and can be changed using the "mode" dropdown.
- Most draw modes are animated in some way, and can be paused using the "pause" toggle.
- A number of draw modes use the mouse to draw points. Some modes have a predefined set of points that you can add, using the "plot" button.
- Finally, the "reset" button will clear the canvas, reset time, and erase all points.

A more in-depth explanation of each mode can be read below.
